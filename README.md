# Walmart-Data-Analysis
A simple data analysis project conducted on Walmart, using Python to clean, filter, and visualize data

### Project Description
A beginner data analysis project which uses data gathered across 45 Walmart stores. The objective of this project focuses on the company's market trends such as average weekly sales, unemployment patterns, comapring yearly CPI measures across 3 fiscal years, and the distribution of holidays across the 45 stores.

### Data Source
Walmart Data: The dataset used for this analysis is called "Walmart Data Analysis and Forecasting", and was borrowed from Kaggle.com

### Tools
All the tools in this project used the Python data analysis packages:

- Pandas: Used for DataFrame creation and grouping different column attributes for a more concise analysis
- Matplotlib: Used to create all the graphs/visualizations for this project

### Data Filtering

1. Finding the number of columns
2. Finding data-type information
3. Finding the shape of the data

### Data Cleaning

Steps I took to clean the dataset:

- Finding null values and removing them for accuracy

### Data Exploration / Visualization

#### Exploration

Asked the following questions:
- What is the percentage of holidays that employees have avaliable?
- What is the average number fo weekly sales across the 45 stores?
- Which store has the worst staffing shortage (pertaining to unemployement)

#### Visualization
Used matplotlib in order to produce the following graphics:
 - Pie-chart: Mapping the percentage of holidays employees are given vs. not given. Also used in measuring the CPI accross the 3 fiscal years 2010, 2011, and 2012
 - Bar graph: Used to measure the average weekly sales. Also used in measuring the unemployment level across the 45 stores

### Results / Findings

1. The ratio/percentage of holdiays were 7%
2. Highest performing store was store number 20 (GO back and fix this!!!)
3. Store with the lowest unemployment was store 38
4. Highest CPI year was (2011)... made up 36% of sales.
